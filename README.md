# WhippleAnalysisPackage

Old analysis package for Whipple 10m data developed between 2000 and 2002. The package is probably no longer compilable due to changes in C++ since then, the missing low-level Whipple data access libraries (GDF, or GRANITE data format) and the missing code generators. It is here only for historical reasons. The CVS directories are purposefully included as the provide some clues to the dates during which the code was developed.
